# Frog Game

NOTE: In progress!!!!!! Very incomplete

This project aims to explore the [PIXIJS Library](http://www.pixijs.com/) and act as an introduction to its capabilities.

# Running locally

PixiJS resources need to be hosted on a server, since running an html file verbatim results in COORs errors when loading resources like sprites to the webGL/canvas area.  Follow the below steps to quickly get up and running:

* Open the commandline / terminal / etc and enter the following:
* `npm install` This installs the project's dependencies
* `npm run hostserver` This runs a simple server which hosts this project
* Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` to view the frogGame web application
* NOTE: if you're using chrome and do not see changes appear on page, hard refresh by clicking `Ctrl-shift-r`.
